When creating interactive databases such as the one for this project, I do my best to make as many components of the project modular.  Keeping modularity in mind is critical for the health and growth of the project.  Creating functions that are repeated many times makes it so we have fewer lines of code, and if an issue springs up in the project, we can more easily diagnose what could be solving the problem.  I belive the role of a computer scientist is to understand how data flows, and how to take that data, and translate it in the most digestible way for your audience.  It isn't critical to make it readable to everyone, for example, if you work at a company that focuses on email deliverability, those metrics only need to be digestible to those interacting with the data.  

This is so important when working on a project, understanding your audience and how you can taylor the manipulation of the data to be digestible is critical to long term success.
